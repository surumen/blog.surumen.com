            I’m a <a :href="queerLink" v-on:click="onQueerClick()" target="_blank">queer</a> Trinidadian-American <a :href="cisgenderLink" v-on:click="onCisgenderClick()" target="_blank">cisgender</a> woman of color. 
            I work as a Senior Software Engineer at <a href="https://etsy.com" target="_blank">Etsy</a> in New York, and I’ve been 
            active in the engineering world for over 6 years.

            I was lucky enough to have a supportive mother, who got me thalida.com 
            for my 16th birthday. It was one of the best gifts I’ve ever received, 
            and is the reason I've become the developer I am today.
          </p>
          <p>
            I now work with an amazing team during the day, and in the wee hours of 
            the night I hack away at one of my many side projects. I'm always 
            looking for a coding buddy, so if you're interested, get in touch!
